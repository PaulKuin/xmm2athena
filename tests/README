Tests for the XMM2Athena enhanced  SUSS catalogue with providing 

To provide a test subset from SUSS we will select a small range in RA so that we are sure to include multiple observations of the same field.
Along with this we select a subset of the Gaia DR3 sources with PM > 25 mas/yr for the selected range in RA. 
The training sets are small enough to keep them as is.

1a. a single source catalogue in several steps:
    - combining multiple records with the same source name, computing the median magnitudes and error, chi-squared for multiple observations
    - matching each source to the Gaia DR3 sources with proper motion > 0.25 mas/yr.
    - matching all sources without PM match in Gaia DR3 ti Gaia DR3 to get the Gaia magnitudes 
    - combining the results from these two matches, including those without match
    Note that some sources will be too faint to match with Gaia     
    For ease of use the code will be adapted to use a config .ini file (TBD)
1b. Enhancing the source catalogue with external data in an augmentation step. Here scripts match each source with available catalogues 
    The magnitudes are added to the catalogue after merging those which are found from multiple surveys, e.g., the R magnitude might be in both PanStarrs as well as in UKIRT. 
    some have up to 5 magnitudes. These are combined in the scripts which are called by the python code.

2. Classification: Here we run the CLAXBOI set with the config.ini file which is in classification/CLAXBOI/classificationcode/

3. Temporal: 
   In xmm2athena.py module there are programs to run. HowTo will be described here TBD.
