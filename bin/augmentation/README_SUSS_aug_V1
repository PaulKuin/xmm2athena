Augmented SUSS catalogue, version 1.0.
README file version 1.0.

Author: Mat Page MSSL

Description:

The augmented SUSS catalogue contains the primary table from
XMM-OM-SUSS5.0.fits with additional columns containing photometry from ground
and space based large-sky-area surveys. SUSS sources were matched to the
external catalogues with a matching radius of 3 arc seconds to the SUSS
positions, taking the closest match in the external catalogue to the SUSS
coordinates within the search radius. The "CDS Upload X-Match" feature was used
within Topcat to do the matching. The resulting matched files were then
post-processed using Stilts to combine the various catalogues and remove
superfluous columns.  As part of this process, the multiple measurements in
various UKIDSS catalogues were reduced to a single set of UKIRT magnitudes for
each source. Similarly, VISTA Viking and VHS surveys were combined such that
there is only one set of VISTA magnitudes for each source.

The surveys used for version 1.0 augmented catalogue are:

Optical:
Pan-STARRS DR1
SkyMapper DR1.1

Near-infrared:
UKIDSS (GPS DR6, DXS DR9, GCS DR9, LAS DR9)
VISTA (VIKING DR2, VHS DR5)

Mid- and far-infrared:
AllWISE (version 16/02/2021)
