Procedures and scripts used to create the augmented SUSS catalogue.

Main tool TOPCAT version 4.8-4

Initial activities to correlate SUSS with individual catalogues for subsequent
combinging and merging.

Used CDS Upload X-Match in TOPCAT to correlate XMM-OM-SUSS5.0.fits with
PanSTARRS DR1 (catalogue name: II/349/ps1), 3 arcsecond search radius, nearest
match to each source in SUSS. Output file: SUSS_PS.fits

Used CDS Upload X-Match in TOPCAT to correlate XMM-OM-SUSS5.0.fits with
Skymapper DR1.1 (catalogue name: II/358/smss), 3 arcsecond search radius, nearest
match to each source in SUSS. Output file: SUSS_SM.fits

Used CDS Upload X-Match in TOPCAT to correlate XMM-OM-SUSS5.0.fits with
various UKIDSS and VISTA surveys detailed below, 3 arcsecond search radius, 
nearest match to each source in SUSS. 
UKIDSS DR9 LAS: (catalogue name: II/319/las9)    Output file: SUSS_LAS.fits
UKIDSS DR9 GCS: (catalogue name: II/319/gcs9)    Output file: SUSS_GCS.fits
UKIDSS DR9 DXS: (catalogue name: II/319/dxs9)    Output file: SUSS_DXS.fits
UKIDSS DR6 GPS: (catalogue name: II/316/gps6)    Output file: SUSS_GPS.fits
VIKING DR2:     (catalogue name: II/343/viking2) Output file: SUSS_VIK.fits
VHS    DR5:     (catalogue name: II/367/vhs_dr5) Output file: SUSS_VHS.fits

Used CDS Upload X-Match in TOPCAT to correlate XMM-OM-SUSS5.0.fits with
ALLWISE version 16-Feb-2021 (catalogue name: II/328/allwise), 
3 arcsecond search radius, nearest match to each source in SUSS. 
Output file: SUSS_WIS.fits

Subsequenctly to these matches, processing and merging of UKIDSS and VISTA 
catalogues takes place. 

For UKIDSS, Petrosian magnitudes  not present in the upload-CDS-xmatch
catalogue functionality) are added to the UKIDSS
photometry. This is achieved using a multi-cone-search, correlating only those 
sources with UKIDSS counterparts to keep matching time within reasonable 
boundaries. Surveys are then combined into one file, with one set of 
UKIRT magnitudes. Priority sequence for selecting magnitudes 
(highest to lowest): GCS DXS GPS LAS.
This is encapsulated in script UKIRT_augment.csh
Output: SUSS_UK_pet.fits

For VISTA, surveys are merged into one file, with one set of VISTA magnitudes.
Prirority sequence for selecting magnitudes (highest to lowest): Viking VHS.
This is encapsulated in script VISTA_merge.csh
Output: SUSS_VI.fits

Then, PannSTARS, Skymapper, UKIDSS, VISTA and WISE catalogue photometry are merged into a single augmented SUSS catalogue.
Script: concat_data_v2.csh
Output: SUSS_aug_V3.fits

Then Vega magnitudes are converted to AB using AB_mag = Vega_mag + AB_offset
